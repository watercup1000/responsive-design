            <h3>Picking a Web Page:</h3>
            <img src="Screen Shot 2022-10-17 at 10.52.58 AM.png" alt="destroylonely.net website screenshot">
            <p>I chose this website due to the sleek minimilist design, and the fact that I'm a fan of this artist.</p>

            <h3>Finding Problems:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Videos button does not work</li>
              <li>Picture is not centered</li>
              <li>While the site is simple, I believe there is room for improvement in useability. The large picture in the middle
                doesn't serve a direct purpose, so I plan to restrucure this picture to display the latest song release while still maintaining
                an aesthetic look
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
            <p>I detected that ARIA IDâ€™s are not unique. I also discovered ARIA items do not have accessible names. I agree with the problems detected. Changes need to be made
              so that people with vision impairments are able to use the webpage.

        <p>Notes: For my edited website, I chose to keep the minimilistic theme, but add some flair of my own. I thought the retro theme fit 
          well with the aesthetic of the particular artist, which is what inspiried the design of the intro page/button. Additionally when using 
          the site you'll notice a unique cursor, which I believe adds to the 90s/retro theme.
